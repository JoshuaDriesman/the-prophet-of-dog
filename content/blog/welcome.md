The goal of this blog is to follow the adventures of our Bichon Frise puppy, Eliyahu (Eli for short). Jay (my partner), our puppy, and I (Joshua) live in Watertown, MA. At the time of writing, he's around seven months old and a very good puppy. Follow along as he explores the world in his cute, sometimes funny, fashion.

The current plan is that most of these posts will consist of a small blurb of text and a cute photo. Nothing too complicated, just short and sweet. Hopefully Eliyahu can bring some cuteness into your day.

Without further ado, here is Eli, very tired from a visit to the dog park today, sleeping on our couch.
