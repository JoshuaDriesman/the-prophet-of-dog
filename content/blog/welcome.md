The goal of this blog is to follow the adventures of our Bichon Frise puppy, Eliyahu (Eli for short). The characters in this story to start out will be Eli, my partner (Jay), and myself (Joshua). We live in Watertown, Massachusetts, which is adjacent to Boston. At the time of writing, Eli is around seven months old and a very good puppy. Follow along as he explores the world in his cute, sometimes funny, fashion.

The current plan is that most of these posts will consist of a small blurb of text and a cute photo. Nothing too complicated, just short and sweet. Hopefully Eliyahu can bring some cuteness into your day.

Without further ado, here is Eli, very tired from a visit to the dog park today, sleeping on our couch.
