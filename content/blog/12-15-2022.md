Today started out with a very happy puppy, despite Jay being gone for the day at work.

In order to get some energy out after lunch, we went to the nearby park to play fetch in the field. Unfortunately, with the melting snow and today's rain, puppy got quite muddy.

He got a bath right after we got inside. He got a major case of the zoomies afterwards.

After drying off though, he was back to his usual fluffy self, with a coat as white as snow!

Good night and hopefully see you all tomorrow!
